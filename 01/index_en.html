    <h3>A little bit about yourself</h3>
    <p>At the moment I live and finish 11 math class in a school-lyceum, urban-type settlement Kazatin (Vinnytsia region). <br> I want to gain experience and develop in the topic of IT-technologies. I also think it's best to work with your head. My goal is to become a front-end and back-end specialist.</p>
    <p>I am fond of sports (football, swimming, workout). Also partial to video games. I tried to create my own. I spend most of my time on things that interest me. Since studying at the school is gray and the teachers are not interested in the students,<br> I began to think more about my further development and became more engaged in online learning. <i> I do not intend to go anywhere after the 11th grade, and therefore I will do my best to go to online work.</i></p>
